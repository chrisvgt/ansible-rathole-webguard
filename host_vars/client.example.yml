# Rathole configuration for server2 (acting as a client)
rathole_role: "client" # This variable tells the template it's a client
rathole_client_config: # This will contain all top-level client settings
  remote_addr: "server1.example.com:2333" # Necessary. The address of the Rathole server.
  default_token: "default_token_if_not_specify" # Optional. Default token for services.
  heartbeat_timeout: 40 # Optional. In seconds.
  retry_interval: 1 # Optional. In seconds.

  # Optional: Transport layer configuration for the client
  # Only ONE 'type' should be uncommented and configured at a time.
  transport:
    type: "noise" # Selected transport type: Noise for secure, lightweight encryption.

    # --- Noise Transport Configuration ---
    noise:

      # IMPORTANT: For Noise to work, 'local_private_key' and 'remote_public_key'
      # are usually required for key exchange. Uncomment and provide actual keys.
