# Ansible Lint configuration
# Keep it strict enough to catch issues, but skip role metadata until added.
profile: production

skip_list:
  - meta-no-info      # roles are missing meta/main.yml for now
  - meta-incorrect    # same as above

# Optionally, you can list specific files to lint, but CI runs ansible-lint site.yml
# to traverse roles used by the playbook automatically.
